# Generate diffenerent features for fullerene

For detailed descirption for what are node, edge, pentagon and hexagon feature in fullerene structure, readers can check out former paper:  [Mapping structure-property relationships in fullerene systems: a computational study from C20 to C60](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-024-01410-7)

We also provide code to generate edge index which tell the connectivty of each atoms in a fullerene molecule in `node_feature_generate.py` .

To generate features need for training FullereneNet. Please run: `python generate_all_features.py`
